## 🛠️ Technical Approach

- **Language**: Rust with PyO3 bindings for Python integration
- **Strategy**: Gradual replacement of performance-critical components
- **Compatibility**: 100% API compatibility with existing Rez
- **Fallback**: Automatic fallback to Python implementation if Rust fails

## 📊 Expected Outcomes

**Optimistic**: 4-6x overall performance improvement
**Realistic**: 2-3x improvement in critical paths
**Pessimistic**: Valuable Rust learning experience 😄

## 🔧 Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.70+ (install via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/))
- Python 3.8+ (for PyO3 bindings with ABI3 support)
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) (recommended Python package manager)
- Git

### Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/loonghao/rez-core.git
cd rez-core

# Install uv (if not already installed)
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh  # Unix
# or
powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"  # Windows

# Set up development environment
uv sync --all-extras
```

### Building and Testing

#### Windows (PowerShell)
```powershell
# Development build with Python bindings
.\scripts\build.ps1 build-dev

# Run Python tests
.\scripts\build.ps1 test-python

# Run all tests (Python + Rust)
.\scripts\build.ps1 test

# Build ABI3 wheel for distribution
.\scripts\build.ps1 build-wheel

# Run performance benchmarks
.\scripts\build.ps1 benchmark

# Format and lint code
.\scripts\build.ps1 format
.\scripts\build.ps1 lint
```

#### Unix/Linux/macOS (Make)
```bash
# Development build
make build-dev

# Run tests
make test

# Build wheel
make build-wheel

# Run benchmarks
make benchmark

# Format and lint
make format
make lint
```

### Performance Profiling

We use [flamegraph](https://github.com/flamegraph-rs/flamegraph) for performance analysis, following pydantic-core's approach:

```bash
# Install flamegraph (requires perf on Linux)
cargo install flamegraph

# Build with profiling symbols
.\scripts\build.ps1 build-profiling  # Windows
# or
make build-profiling  # Unix

# Profile Python benchmarks
flamegraph -- uv run pytest tests/python/ -k test_version_creation_performance --benchmark-enable

# Profile Rust benchmarks
flamegraph -- cargo bench

# The flamegraph command will produce an interactive SVG at flamegraph.svg
```

**Note**: On Windows, flamegraph requires additional setup. Consider using Linux/WSL for profiling.

## 🔄 CI/CD Pipeline

We use a simplified CI/CD configuration inspired by [pydantic-core](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-core) best practices:

### Continuous Integration (`ci.yml`)
Our main CI workflow includes:
- **Coverage**: Code coverage testing with `cargo-llvm-cov` and `pytest`
- **Test Python**: Multi-version Python testing (3.8-3.13, including freethreaded 3.13t)
- **Test OS**: Cross-platform testing (Ubuntu, macOS, Windows)
- **Test Rust**: Rust testing, linting (`cargo fmt`, `cargo clippy`), and benchmarks
- **Lint**: Code quality checks using project's `make lint` commands
- **Audit**: Security auditing with `cargo-audit` and `cargo-deny`
- **Build**: Wheel building and installation testing

### Release Pipeline (`release.yml`)
Automated release process:
- **Multi-platform builds**: Linux, macOS, Windows (x86_64 + aarch64 where supported)
- **Source distribution**: Automated sdist creation
- **GitHub releases**: Automatic release creation with generated notes
- **PyPI publishing**: Automated publishing to PyPI with trusted publishing

### Key Features
- ✅ **Multi-platform support**: Ubuntu, macOS, Windows
- ✅ **Multi-Python support**: Python 3.8-3.13 (including freethreaded)
- ✅ **Multi-architecture**: x86_64 and aarch64 (where supported)
- ✅ **Comprehensive testing**: Python, Rust, linting, security audits
- ✅ **Automated releases**: Tag-triggered builds and PyPI publishing

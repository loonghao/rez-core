### API Highlights
```rust
// Parse package.py files
let package = PackageSerializer::load_from_file("package.py")?;

// Create packages programmatically
let mut package = Package::new("my_tool".to_string());
package.version = Some(Version::parse("1.0.0")?);
package.requires = vec!["python-3.9".to_string()];

// Validate packages
let validator = PackageValidator::new(Some(PackageValidationOptions::full()));
let result = validator.validate_package(&package)?;

// Package management
let manager = PackageManager::new();
manager.install_package(&package, "/path/to/install", None)?;
```

### Python API
```python
from rez_next_package import Package, PackageValidator, PackageManager

# Load and validate packages
package = Package.load_from_file("package.py")
validator = PackageValidator.full()
result = validator.validate_package(package)

# Package operations
manager = PackageManager()
manager.install_package(package, "/path/to/install")
```

## Development Notes

### Package.py Parsing Implementation
The package.py parser uses RustPython's AST to provide complete Python compatibility:
- **Variable Assignments**: Direct field mapping (name = "value")
- **Function Definitions**: Commands function parsing with environment handling
- **Complex Expressions**: List comprehensions, dictionary operations
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of syntax errors with detailed reporting

### Validation System Design
The validation system provides multiple levels of checking:
- **Syntax Validation**: Basic field type and format checking
- **Semantic Validation**: Dependency consistency and requirement validation
- **Business Logic**: Custom rules for specific package requirements
- **Performance**: Parallel validation for large package sets

### Future Improvements
- **Enhanced AST Parsing**: Support for more complex Python constructs
- **Advanced Validation**: ML-based package quality assessment
- **Performance Optimization**: Further memory and speed improvements
- **Extended Formats**: Support for additional package definition formats

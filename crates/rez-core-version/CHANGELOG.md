### API Highlights
```rust
// Fast version parsing
let version = Version::parse("2.1.0-beta.1+build.123")?;

// Version comparisons
assert!(Version::parse("1.0.0")? < Version::parse("2.0.0")?);

// Version ranges
let range = VersionRange::parse(">=1.0.0,<2.0.0")?;
assert!(range.contains(&Version::parse("1.5.0")?));

// Batch operations
let versions = batch::parse_versions(&["1.0.0", "2.0.0", "1.5.0"])?;
let sorted = batch::sort_versions(versions);
```

### Python API
```python
from rez_core_version import Version, VersionRange

# Fast version operations
version = Version("2.1.0-beta.1")
print(f"Major: {version.major}")

# Version comparisons
versions = [Version("1.0.0"), Version("2.0.0"), Version("1.5.0")]
sorted_versions = sorted(versions)

# Range operations
range = VersionRange(">=1.0.0,<2.0.0")
assert range.contains(Version("1.5.0"))
```
